This repository helps those who has just started or has intermediate experince in machine learning. It contains numerous examples, white papers/research papers , Blogs, implemented algorithms and business usecase documents.
Our only goal is to help newcomers in datascience and hence future as well, will keep updating this repo with link papers and document related to new learning. 
Your feedback, comments & appreciation is always aids to improve further
